          <p class="card-text" id="UserCardText">A major component of Big Creek Reservation is Big Creek Parkway, a refreshing alternative to the standard suburban commuter routes to Cleveland. The reservation runs parallel to Pearl Road from Valley Parkway to Brookpark Road, and is located in Brooklyn, Parma, Parma Heights, Middleburg Heights, and Strongsville. Undoubtedly the highlight of the reservation is the Lake to Lake Trail, a 2.4 mile, universally accessible all purpose trail that connects Lake Abram to Lake Isaac. On foot, by bicycle, or by wheelchair, one crosses Abram Creek and Bagley Road as they travel the trail that passes through 175 acres of headwater wetlands joining the largest kettle lakes in Cuyahoga County.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title" id="UserCardTitle">Brecksville Reservation</h5>
          <p class="card-text" id="UserCardText">From the oak-hickory forests on the ridge tops to the cottonwoods, willows and sycamores of Chippewa Creek's flat floodplain, Brecksville Reservation is a study of contrasts. The reservation is deeply cut by seven distinct gorges which have a wide variety of soil and sunlight conditions, fostering the growth of rare, unusual and endangered plants. Chippewa Creek, in the northern section of the reservation, flows through a remarkable gorge that was left behind by the glaciers that once covered this area. The reservation has an excellent and extensive system of trails, including a section of the Buckeye Trail. Squire Rich Home & Museum, managed by the Brecksville Historical Society, is located on Brecksville Road. Sleepy Hollow Golf Course and Seneca Golf Course are also a part of the reservation.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="card-text" id="UserCardText">Brookside Reservation was one of the City of Cleveland's oldest neighborhood parks before its acquisition by Cleveland Metroparks in 1993. The land was purchased in 1894 and has been a center for recreation since the early 1900s. Still a recreation hub, the area now boasts baseball and soccer/football fields. The 135-acre reservation serves as a refuge for diverse wildlife in an urban setting. It is also an attractive spot for area picnickers and a resting site for walkers, cyclists and others who use the All Purpose Trail. This reservation connects to Cleveland Metroparks Zoo</p>

          <h5 class="card-title" id="UserCardTitle">Rocky River Reservation</h5>
          <p class="card-text" id="UserCardText">The character of the reservation is strongly influenced by the Rocky River. Massive shale cliffs rise above the willows, sycamores and cottonwoods, and many trails wind through the valley's deep floodplain forests, meadows and wetlands. Wildlife is common in the valley and visitors can expect to see numerous bird species and some common Ohio mammals year-round, including the white-tailed deer.</p>
